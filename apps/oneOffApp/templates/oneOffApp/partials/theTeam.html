            <p><b>Producer, Ana Maria Campoy</b> is a teaching artist, producer, and actor. Her last project, Gifts of War, produced alongside, Gin Hammond, was a theatre and dance collaboration performed at Velocity Founder’s Theatre in fall 2014. Performances were all nearly sold out. Post-performances discussions with Soldier’s Heart were held about the effects of war on women both on the front lines fighting and those who are living with war around them. Through a partnership with YouthCare, they gave free workshops to all of their residents living at transitional housing and hosted an Arts Career Panel. As a teaching artist, Ana Maria has worked with children of migrant workers, homeless youth, recovering drug addicts, and students in public schools across Puget Sound on behalf of Book-It Repertory Theatre, Seattle Rep, and Pacific Northwest Ballet. In July 2014, she served on the grant panel for Seattle Arts and Culture’s Arts Means Business Grant. As a first generation Mexican-American, providing an artistic voice for artists of color and community activism is a central focus in her work.
